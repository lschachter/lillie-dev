    'One Word Answers to Impossible Questions' is a small book of philosophical questions with scientifically proven one-word answers, connected to a website that goes deeper into the science and philosophy (and in some cases opinions) behind the book’s answers. 

    The classic example of this phenomenon is ‘Which came first, the chicken or the egg?’. The answer is egg. But why? Because of the theory of evolution, we know that something not-quite-a-chicken laid an egg with a _mutated_ not-quite-a-chicken in it, the first chicken. Therefore, the egg came first. 

    This is a work in progress so there’s nothing to check out quite yet, but will eventually be another static site built with Hugo. In the meantime, you can [email me](mailto:lillieschachter@gmail.com) directly if you’re interested in learning more!
