    Best Bet 55 is an app designed to gamify sports betting. It is written using `Django Rest Framework` and `PostgreSQL` in the backend, and `React Native` and `TypeScript` in the frontend. It is hosted on `AWS`, fully `Docker`-ized to enable use of Amazonâ€™s **Elastic Container Service (ECS)**. The app utilizes an API called `therundown` to track live game information. 

    As a Jr. Backend developer on a team of six, I have had the opportunity to contribute in many ways. I have

    - Owned the follower functionality from back- to front- end, building new RESTful endpoints with `Django` and connecting them to the `React` app with `TypeScript`

    - Written thorough unit tests for all new features and code changes

    - Optimized SQL queries with `Prefetch` and `select_related`, pinpointing problems and checking my solutions with Django's built in SQL Debugger

    - Refactored pure `JavaScript` and `React Native` code to utilize `TypeScript` and `React Hooks`, minimizing future tech debt
    
    Next I will be creating a staging environment to match our production env in ECS.
