  I cohost the [Meaning in Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWfEGcOLGTc&t=8s) podcast with my friend and colleague [Bennett Garner](https://bennettgarner.com/). In it, we discuss the pursuit of fulfillment and a sense of meaning within a software engineering career,  where that pursuit has served each of us, and where it sometimes has not. 

  Topics discussed range from how to identify what brings you fulfillment, to recipes that make work-from-home lunch breaks less absorbed in cleaning dishes. 

  You can check us out on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWfEGcOLGTc&t=8s) or wherever you listen to podcasts.
