    ‘Diagonal Dominoes’ is a 2-player game (based on a mini-game in the video game of Avatar: The Last Airbender for PS2. I’m _that_ kind of nerd). Each player starts out with 5 tiles, each of 2 colors. After the first move, you can only lay a tile of the same color as the last one put down. The goal is to block your opponent from having a next move, or to place all of your tiles before they do. Player 2 is an AI designed to win if possible, and if not, to choose a move based on how many ways the human player can lose. 

    I originally built this game as a midterm project for my ‘Algorithmic Game Theory’ class at Connecticut College. I used a weighted mini-max algorithm to build the tree of possible moves for the AI player. It is fully functional (and the absolute highlight of my academic career), built using Python 3 and Zelle’s Graphics package. The downside is that it’s absolutely hideous _because_ it’s written with Zelle’s Graphics package. To the point that I’m not putting any pictures of it up here. But the code is up on GitHub here, and I am working on rebuilding it to be presentable.
