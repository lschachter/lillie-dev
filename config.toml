Missing programming, I transitioned into software engineering from there. \n\nI enjoy, among other things, video games, karaoke, and potatoes. So many potatoes. Literally the background image on my computer is a stock image of mashed potatoes, it’s a thing. \n\nYou can find me on LinkedIn, GitHub, or email me directly here."
