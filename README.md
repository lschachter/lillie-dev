###### Personal Website

Hello! This is a personal website built using the static site generator [`Hugo`](https://gohugo.io/). The [`hugo-creative-theme`](https://themes.gohugo.io/creative/) provided the foundation for the format. 

This site houses

- Subsets of algorithm problems that I've worked through (all of which can be found in my `algorithm-practice` repo [here](https://github.com/lschachter/algorithm-practice))
- Events that I have contributed to or spoken at as part of the CS community
- Projects that I have worked on and am currently working on
- My resume

To run this project on your local machine, you'll need to have [`Hugo`](https://gohugo.io/) installed. The simplest (and suggested) way to do this is through [`Homebrew`](https://brew.sh/) with `brew install hugo`. You can verify that this worked with `hugo version`. 


### Running Locally

Once it's installed, clone this repo and `cd` into it. From there you can run `hugo server` and visit your localhost at the port it points you to (1313)!
